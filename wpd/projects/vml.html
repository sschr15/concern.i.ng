                        Version Mod Loader is a mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/),
                        which is a mod loader for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/).
                        It allows you to load mods from a folder that is specific to the
                        Minecraft version you are using.
                    </p>

                        How does it work?

                    <p markdown>
                        The tool is written entirely in Java to require no additional dependencies.
                        It goes in a Minecraft instance's `mods` folder, and loads mods from
                        a different folder depending on the Minecraft version. It will also load all
                        mods in the `common` subfolder, regardless of the Minecraft version.
                    </p>

                        Version Mod Loader makes loading different versions under the same folder
                        very easy. You can use it to load mods in a way that allows other mods
                        or language adapters to work without requiring multiple copies
                        of the same mod in different folders.

                        Just put Version Mod Loader in your Minecraft instance's `mods` folder,
                        and launch the game. VML will, on each new version's launch, create 
                        a folder in the `mods` folder called `<version>`, and load mods from
                        there. If you want to manually create a folder for a version,
                        you can do so by creating a folder with the same name as the version
                        in the `mods` folder.

                        Version Mod Loader is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sschr15/Version-Mod-Loader).
                        It is also available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/vml).

                        It is compatible with every Minecraft version that Fabric supports, but it is not compatible
                        with every version of the Fabric mod loader. It has been tested against versions known to support
                        Minecraft 1.16, so it likely will work with any version of Fabric installed in the past many years.
