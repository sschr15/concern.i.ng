                        Matrix Visualizer is a small program written in Kotlin that allows you to create
                        black-and-white Tetris-like visualizations of matrices with individual blocks.
                    </p>

                <td width="50%">
                    <h3>
                        How does it work?
                    </h3>
                    <p markdown>
                        The tool is written entirely in Kotlin referencing some libraries
                        to create the files that it exports.

                        This program uses
                        [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) for the actual code and its standard libraries,
                        [JFreeSVG](https://jfree.org/jfreesvg/) for creating vector graphics of the matrix, and
                        [Apache's Batik](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) for converting the SVG to PNG.
                    </p>

                        Matrix Visualizer is a tool that I wrote to help me visualize the matrices I use in my
                        Tetris Effect: Connected kirbtris solves. It makes blocks look nice.

                        Other people can use it too!

                        How do I use it?

                        Download the jar file from [GitHub](https://github.com/sschr15/matrix-visualizer/releases/latest)
                        and run it in a command prompt or other terminal.

                        For the GUI version, there currently is no available download because JavaFX is painful
                        to work with. In order to use the GUI version, you need to 
                        [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
                        and run the `gradlew run` command (if on [[Unix-like|*nix]], you can run `chmod +x gradlew && ./gradlew run`).

            The matrix images are generated by this tool and can be manually recreated. There is no particular source for them.

            The eyeball logo surrounded by green is an edited image of unknown origin.
            The image was modified by me as a way to identify myself.
